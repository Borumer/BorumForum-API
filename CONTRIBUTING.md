# Contributing Guide

This guide is intended for developers of clients of the Borum Forum API, people who want to contribute to the Borum Forum API codebase, or people who want to install from source and make local changes to their copy of the Borum Forum API.

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas are welcome. I track issues on GitHub.

*Wanna improve the documentation? Head on over to the [Borum-Dev-Documentation repository](https://github.com/Borumer/Borum-Dev-Documentation) for contributing to documentation*
